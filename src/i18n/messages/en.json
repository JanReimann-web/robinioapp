      "________________________________________",
      "1. What data we process",
      "1.1 Account and authentication data (Google/Firebase)",
      "The app enables sign-in with a Google account and uses Firebase Authentication. We may process:",
      "1. Firebase user identifier (UID);",
      "2. name, email, and profile picture URL if provided by the Google account and displayed in the app;",
      "3. technical authentication metadata (e.g., sign-in events required for service operation).",
      "1.2 User-entered financial data (app content)",
      "The app allows you to enter data that may be personal data, such as:",
      "1. transactions (income/expense), amounts, currency, dates, categories, notes;",
      "2. planned transactions;",
      "3. budget and budget cycle settings;",
      "4. \"opening balance\" (total balance on a selected date) for forecasts;",
      "5. savings goals and related information.",
      "These data are generally stored locally on your device in the app's private storage (e.g., local database and settings).",
      "1.3 Free trial data",
      "To manage the free trial, we may process a timestamp for the start of the trial period. It may be stored:",
      "1. locally on the device;",
      "2. as a record associated with your account in Firebase Firestore (to prevent unfair trial restarts and keep the trial account-based).",
      "1.4 Premium subscription data (Google Play Billing)",
      "Premium subscription is managed via Google Play. The app may process:",
      "1. subscription status (active/inactive);",
      "2. expiration time (if applicable);",
      "3. technical data needed to validate the subscription (e.g., purchase token).",
      "Payment data (e.g., card number) do not come to us; they are processed by Google Play.",
      "To verify subscription validity, the app may transmit the purchase token and product ID to our Firebase Cloud Functions service, which checks the subscription.",
      "1.5 Device backup and restore (Android backup/transfer)",
      "Depending on your Android settings, Android may:",
      "1. back up the app's local data to backups associated with your Google account;",
      "2. restore the app's data when you change or restore your device.",
      "This means that although MoneyBear does not provide separate cloud sync for your transactions (except for trial and subscription verification), your local app data may be transferred to Google backup services due to your own settings.",
      "1.6 Technical data and logs",
      "Third-party service providers (e.g., Google/Firebase) may collect technical logs (e.g., service errors, security events) for service operation and security.",
      "________________________________________",
      "2. Purposes of processing",
      "We process data to:",
      "1. provide the app's features and display user-entered data;",
      "2. enable sign-in and link the app experience to the signed-in user;",
      "3. separate information displayed in the app for different users on the same device based on the signed-in account;",
      "4. manage the free trial;",
      "5. manage the Premium subscription and verify its validity;",
      "6. provide user support and ensure security and reliability.",
      "________________________________________",
      "3. Legal bases (GDPR)",
      "Where GDPR applies, we primarily rely on:",
      "1. performance of a contract (providing the app service, account, subscription);",
      "2. legitimate interests (security, abuse prevention, service reliability, customer support);",
      "3. legal obligations, where they arise (e.g., dispute resolution, accounting requirements to the extent they apply to us).",
      "________________________________________",
      "4. Who we share data with",
      "We do not sell your personal data or share it for advertising purposes.",
      "We may use service providers (processors), in particular:",
      "1. Google Play / Google (subscriptions, billing, purchase history, anti-fraud);",
      "2. Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) for sign-in, storing trial information, and subscription verification;",
      "3. Android backup and device data transfer mechanisms (Google services) depending on your device settings.",
      "We may disclose data where necessary to comply with legal obligations or protect rights.",
      "________________________________________",
      "5. Data retention",
      "1. Local financial data remain on your device until you delete them (e.g., \"Clear app data\"), uninstall the app, or restore your device.",
      "2. The trial start timestamp record (Firestore) generally remains until account deletion or a deletion request.",
      "3. Subscription verification data are retained only to the minimum necessary extent; purchase history and billing information remain in Google Play systems according to Google's rules.",
      "4. Device backups (if enabled) are retained according to your Google account and Android backup rules.",
      "________________________________________",
      "6. Security",
      "1. Core app data are stored in the device's private storage.",
      "2. The app uses the internet (e.g., sign-in, subscription verification) and data transmission is typically encrypted (TLS).",
      "3. We recommend using a screen lock and keeping your Google account secure.",
      "4. No security measure provides absolute protection; we take reasonable steps but cannot eliminate all risks.",
      "________________________________________",
      "7. Your rights",
      "Depending on applicable law, you have the right to:",
      "1. request access to your personal data;",
      "2. request correction or deletion;",
      "3. restrict processing or object (where based on legitimate interests);",
      "4. request data portability where applicable.",
      "How to request: write to support@moneybear.eu.",
      "To fulfill a privacy request, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity (e.g., Google account email or Firebase UID).",
      "________________________________________",
      "8. How to delete data",
      "1. Logging out in the app may not physically delete local data; it primarily removes access to the signed-in experience.",
      "2. To delete local information, use Android's \"Clear storage / Clear data\" function or uninstall the app.",
      "3. To request deletion of trial or account-related server data, write to support@moneybear.eu.",
      "________________________________________",
      "9. Children's privacy",
      "1. The app is intended for general use and may also be used by minors.",
      "2. The app uses Google sign-in; account creation and use are subject to Google's own rules.",
      "3. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a minor has provided us data in a way that requires intervention, contact: support@moneybear.eu.",
      "________________________________________",
      "10. International transfers",
      "Google/Firebase services may process data on servers outside the European Economic Area. In such cases, transfers rely on the legal mechanisms used by the provider (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses), where applicable.",
      "________________________________________",
      "11. Changes to the privacy policy",
      "We may update the Policy from time to time. The updated version will be published and the \"Last updated\" date will change.",
